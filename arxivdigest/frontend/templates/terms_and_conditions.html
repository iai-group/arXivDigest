                    to review these Terms periodically.</p>
                <p>Your continued use of the Service following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept and
                    agree to the changes. You are expected to check this page frequently so you are aware of any
                    changes, as they are binding on you.</p>
                <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be
                    bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to

                <h4>19. Waiver And Severability</h4>
                <p>No waiver by IAI of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall be deemed a further or
                    continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any
                    failure of IAI to assert a right or provision under Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such
                    right or provision.</p>
                <p>If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be
                    invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to
                    the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of Terms will continue in full force and
                    effect.</p>
